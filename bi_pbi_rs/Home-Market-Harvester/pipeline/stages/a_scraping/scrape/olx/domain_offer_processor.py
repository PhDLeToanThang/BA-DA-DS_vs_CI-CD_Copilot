"""
This module provides functionality for processing real estate offers 
from OLX and Otodom websites. 
It includes functions to handle individual offer processing for each site, 
utilizing Selenium WebDriver for web interactions. 
The module is responsible for extracting offer data, saving it in CSV format, 
and managing the progress of the scraping task. 
It employs robust error handling and logging mechanisms 
to deal with and report any issues 
encountered during the offer processing stage.
