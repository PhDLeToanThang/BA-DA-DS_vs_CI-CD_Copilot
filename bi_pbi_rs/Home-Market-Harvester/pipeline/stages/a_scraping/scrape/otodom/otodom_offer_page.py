"""
This module contains functions for managing 
and processing real estate offers from the Otodom website 
in a web scraping context. 
It includes functionality to open individual offer pages in new browser windows, 
extract relevant data using the Selenium WebDriver, 
save the extracted data to CSV files, 
and handle any exceptions that occur during the process. 
The module integrates counter tracking to monitor scraping progress 
and manages the switching between browser windows 
to ensure seamless data collection from multiple offers.
