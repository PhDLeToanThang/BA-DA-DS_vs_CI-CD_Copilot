"""
This module provides functionality for data loading and preprocessing for a real estate application. 
It includes the DataLoader class, which is responsible for loading, preparing, 
and processing real estate offer data. 
The class manages paths for data files, loads data from CSV files, 
and preprocesses the data by converting data types and creating additional data fields.

The module handles data related to user-submitted apartment offers and market offers, 
facilitating various data operations like loading data from CSV files, type conversion, 
and computation of additional metrics such as price per meter. 
It also incorporates error handling for common issues encountered during data loading and parsing.
