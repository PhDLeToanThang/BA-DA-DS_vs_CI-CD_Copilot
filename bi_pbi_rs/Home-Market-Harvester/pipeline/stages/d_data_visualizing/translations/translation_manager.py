"""
This module contains the Translation class, 
a singleton design pattern implementation for managing translations 
in a dashboard application.

The Translation class is responsible for 
handling language settings and retrieving appropriate translation strings. 
It utilizes a dictionary of translations imported from `localization_content.py`, 
which includes various language options defined in the Languages class.

The singleton pattern ensures that there is only a single instance 
of the Translation class throughout the application, 
providing a consistent and centralized translation management system.

Usage:
    To use the Translation class, 
    set the desired language using the set_language method, 
    and retrieve translation strings 
    using the class instance like a dictionary.

Example:
    Translation.set_language("Polish")
    print(Translation()["chart"]["title"])

Methods:
    set_language: Sets the current language for translations.

Raises:
    KeyError: If the key is not found in the translations for the current language.

Note:
    This module depends on `localization_content.py` 
    from the `d_data_visualizing.translations` package for translation data.
