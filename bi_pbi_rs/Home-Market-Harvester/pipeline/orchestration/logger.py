"""
This module provides logging functionalities for a data processing pipeline,
enabling both file-based and console logging with configurable levels of detail.
It is designed to facilitate tracking of the pipeline's execution status,
errors, and warnings by writing logs to a file 
and simultaneously printing them to the console.
