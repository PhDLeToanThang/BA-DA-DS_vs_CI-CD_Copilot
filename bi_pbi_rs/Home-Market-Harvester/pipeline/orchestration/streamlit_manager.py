"""
This module provides mechanisms for integrating Streamlit applications into data processing
pipelines, specifically focusing on the execution and lifecycle management of Streamlit processes.
It facilitates the seamless operation of Streamlit apps as part of broader data engineering and
analysis workflows, offering utilities to start, monitor, and gracefully terminate Streamlit
applications.
